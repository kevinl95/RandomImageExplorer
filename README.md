# Random Image Explorer
A *Mathematica* random image generator and animation exporter inspired by [Reddit /r/allthepictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/allthepictures), a project to find meaningful images in high entropy images.

This tool generates random images of arbitrary size and will do as many images as you wish at once. Best of all, when you generate multiple images they will be shown to you in an animation making it easier to go through many images at once and extract the most interesting ones.

You will need either:

  - [The free *Mathematica* CDF Player](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/) 
  - Wolfram Mathematica

The CDF file in this repository is for the CDF player and the Notebook file for *Mathematica*, respectively.

Download the player or *Mathematica* and then open the file. You will need to enable dynamics to run the tool.

Once you have the file open, simply manipulate the manipulate interface by changing x or y to change the image size, or the image parameter to change the number of pictures you want to generate. Hit enter and the tool will run. The animation can then be viewed.

Animations can be exported from the tool as either a:

 - .GIF
 - .AVI

This makes it easier to quickly find patterns in your images. Happy hunting!
